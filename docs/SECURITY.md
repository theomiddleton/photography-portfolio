# Security Policy

## Overview

This portfolio project implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure operation of both portfolio and e-commerce features. This document outlines our security architecture, authentication systems, and provides guidance for responsible disclosure of security issues.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication System

Our authentication system is built with security-first principles:

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Session Management**: Device tracking, "Remember Me" functionality, and session revocation
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements with bcrypt hashing
- **Account Lockouts**: Automatic account lockouts after failed login attempts
- **Email Verification**: Required email verification for new accounts
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

See [`src/lib/account-security.ts`](src/lib/account-security.ts) for implementation details.

### Authorization

- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin and user roles with appropriate permissions
- **Route Protection**: Protected routes with middleware enforcement
- **Admin Setup**: Secure first admin setup process with race condition prevention
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection on sensitive operations

### Rate Limiting

Comprehensive rate limiting powered by Upstash Redis:

- **Authentication APIs**: 10 attempts per minute per IP for login/password operations
- **Email APIs**: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- **Admin APIs**: 3x multiplier for administrative operations
- **Store APIs**: 10 attempts per minute per IP for checkout operations
- **AI APIs**: 5 attempts per minute per IP (due to computational cost)

See [Rate Limiting Setup](README.md#-rate-limiting-setup-redis) for configuration details.

## üîß Security Configuration

The project uses a centralized security configuration system via [`src/config/security-config.ts`](src/config/security-config.ts) that defines all security parameters and policies.

### Security Configuration Overview

#### Password Security

- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Maximum Length**: 128 characters
- **Requirements**: Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds (industry standard for 2024)

#### JWT Configuration

- **Algorithm**: HS256 (HMAC SHA-256)
- **Secret Requirements**: Minimum 32 characters for cryptographic security
- **Default Expiration**: 168 hours (1 week) - reduced from 30 days for enhanced security
- **Validation**: Automatic secret length validation

#### Session Security

- **Cookie Name**: `session`
- **HTTP Only**: `true` (prevents XSS access)
- **Secure**: `true` (HTTPS only in production)
- **SameSite**: `strict` (CSRF protection)
- **Path**: `/` (application-wide)

#### Account Security Policies

- **Failed Attempts**: Maximum 5 failed login attempts
- **Lockout Duration**: 15 minutes after account lockout
- **Email Verification**: Required for all new accounts
- **Session Invalidation**: Password changes invalidate all existing sessions

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

- **Fail-Closed Endpoints**: `passwordAttempt`, `email`, `upload` (deny when Redis unavailable)
- **Fail-Open Endpoints**: `webhook`, `revalidate` (allow when Redis unavailable)
- **Admin Multiplier**: 3x rate limit for admin operations

#### Input Validation Limits

- **Email**: Maximum 255 characters
- **Name**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Password**: Maximum 128 characters
- **User Agent**: Maximum 100 characters (for logging)

#### Security Logging Configuration

- **Email Masking**: Enabled (protects PII)
- **IP Masking**: Enabled (GDPR compliance)
- **User Agent Truncation**: Enabled
- **Detail Length**: Maximum 200 characters per log entry

- **Coercion**: Automatic type conversion for numeric values

## üõí E-commerce Security

When the store is enabled, additional security measures are implemented:

### Payment Security

- **Stripe Integration**: PCI-compliant payment processing
- **Webhook Verification**: Cryptographic signature validation for all webhooks
- **Payment Validation**: Server-side amount verification
- **Idempotency**: Prevention of duplicate charges

### Store Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All store inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **Transaction Safety**: Database operations wrapped in transactions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all store operations
- **Authorization Checks**: Admin functions properly protected
