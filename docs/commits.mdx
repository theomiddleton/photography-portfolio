### 🗃️ Add database and image data schema
This commit adds the database libraries, for the database I am using planetscale, so I can host it online. The database is mysql, and I am using drizzle to interface with it, drizzle is an orm for mysql, and other databases, but I am only using it for mysql. The image data schema is also added, this is the schema for the imagedata, which is things like the file url, the file name, when it was uploaded and more.
